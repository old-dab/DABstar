That the distance to the transmitter can be shown, do following:
1) Provide your home coordinates with button "Coordinates" on the "Configuraton and Control" windows.
2) Copy libtii-lib.so to /usr/local/lib/    (you will need sudo rights).
3) Press one time "Load Table" on the "Configuraton and Control" window.
4) If 3) should fail you can unzip the content of tiiFile.zip to your home folder. Restart DABstar.
