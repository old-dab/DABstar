To load the newest TII database instead using the default TII database, do this:
1) Copy libtii-lib.so to /usr/local/lib/    (you will need sudo rights).
2) Maybe a call to "sudo ldconfig" is necessary that the new installed library can be found.
3) Press "Load TII Table" on the "Configuraton and Control" window to load a new database from the server. It should be found in $HOME/.txdata.tii.
