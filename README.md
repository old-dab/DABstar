# DABstar

[DABstar](https://github.com/tomneda/DABstar) is derived from Jan van Katwijk's great work of [Qt-DAB](https://github.com/JvanKatwijk/qt-dab)
from [commit](https://github.com/JvanKatwijk/qt-dab/tree/b083a8e169ca2b7dd47167a07b92fa5a1970b249) from 2023-05-30.


There are already many changes made from my side and there will be bigger changes in the future. 
So, I decided to give it the new name DABstar.

I will try to maintain always a working state on mainline (under Linux). 
For installing process please refer to [Qt-DAB](https://github.com/JvanKatwijk/qt-dab).

For building there is one bigger difference to Qt-DAB: I maintain only one GUI version and I provide no *.pro file for qmake anymore, only a CMakeLists.txt file.

I will also not provide any precompiled setup packages, yet.

I will do a more detailed description here later.
